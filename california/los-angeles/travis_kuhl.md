# Travis Kuhl
Web Developer, teamcoco.com - Santa Monica, CA

## 1. What are you working on right now?
During the day I'm a freelance developer, working mostly as on [TeamCoco.com](http://teamcoco.com), the official website of ["Conan"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637574/). Nothing
overly amazing about the technology at TeamCoco, but it's awesome to work on something that has such a passionate following. I'm constantly amazed at
how connected Conan's fans are to the site and how much of a community has grown around it. I've been working on the site since the beginning, when it was just a
single page promotional site for the [The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legally_Prohibited_from_Being_Funny_on_Television_Tour).
Seeing it's tremendous growth in less than a year has been extremely satisfying and an incredible honor to be part of.

At night I work on a plenty of side projects; most of which never get released but are a ton of fun. Here's a few of the highlights:

 * drib [drib](https://github.com/traviskuhl/drib) - open source packaging and deployment manager
 * Bolt [bolt](https://github.com/traviskuhl/bolt) - light weight PHP framework
 * BackyardIo [Backyard.io](http://backyard.io) - something new
 * FourQuestions [fourqu.es/tions](http://fourqu.es/tions) - very meta


## 2. What companies/projects have your worked on in the past?
After college I started my own freelance company. Loved being my own boss, but hated interacting directly with clients. So after a particularly horrible
pitch meeting with a client, I saw a notice on movies.yahoo.com for open positions with Yahoo! In an act of desperation I submitted my resume, with 
the expectation that I would never hear anything back. About a week later I got an email from my future boss asking to set up a phone interview. After a few
more phone interviews, I flew to Los Angeles to do an in person interview. The interview was fairly stressful and I was pretty convinced that I had crashed and burned 
in spectacular fashion.

On January 22, 2007 I started my first day at Yahoo. I spent the first six months completely overwhelmed. I was fairly certain that at some point my coworkers would
realize that I was a complete fraud and had no business working at Yahoo. Luckily they didn't and after the first year I began to feel more comfortable and confident. Working at Yahoo! was a pretty incredible 
experience. My knowledge and skill set grew exponential. The sheer depth and volume of knowledge and experience at that company is truly astounding.

After spending a little over three years at Yahoo, I decided it was time to take on a new challenge. I had worked on some great projects at Yahoo! and learned at ton, but felt it was 
time to give a startup a try. I got an offer to work for a well know LA business guy, who was starting a new company to compete in the young, but growing "daily deal" space. 

At the end of March 2010, I started at DailyD.com. It was a lot of fun. I was working with two close friends (Scott, another engineer and Doug, head of product) and the startup was well funded, so there wasn't
too much pressure (looking back, maybe that wasn't such a great thing). In December of 2010 DailyD was growing fast and I was being to feel like it was time for me to move on. Building DailyD was very rewarding,
but at the end of the day, I felt like it wasn't the best fit for me. 

On January 1, 2011 I returned to my roots and started another freelance company. In addition to working on TeamCoco as a full time contractor and some other contracts here and there, I'm also
working on a few side projects that will hopefully grow over the new few months.


## 3. What are you most proud of?
Working at Yahoo! As much as it's cool to look down on Yahoo! these days, I am incredible proud to have had the opportunity to work at a company with such an amazing history. Regardless of where
Yahoo! is today, Yahoo! played a huge role in the growth and advancement of web developement and the web in general.


## 4. What advice do you have for new developers
Build things. Have side projects. Contribute to open source projects. Even if it never sees the light of day, write as much code as you can. I was constantly shocked by the number of interviews I 
did at Yahoo! where the candidate didn't have one side project on their resume. Having a great education and solid work experience are great, but they don't mean a lot if you can't code. Every great developer I know 
writes code on the side that has no relation to their work. 


## Bonus: Answer your own question: Have you touched Conan's hair?
For some reason whenever I say I work on teamcoco.com, this is the first thing people ask me. The answer is, unfortunately, no.
